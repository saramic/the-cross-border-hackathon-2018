## Challenges

### CHALLENGE 1: FOCUS ON AUSTRALIAN BUSINESSES SELLING TO CHINA
  Not all Australian businesses are fully leveraging their opportunity to
  export to Asia via e-commerce channels due to lack of knowledge of the Asian
  consumers, platforms, export procedures and regulations. How can we use APIs
  from NAB, Alibaba and other third parties to help?

### CHALLENGE 2: FOCUS ON CHINESE TOURISTS AND MIGRANTS COMING TO AUSTRALIA
  Chinese tourists and migrants have difficulty finding and engaging with all
  Australian services (including financial services) when traveling and seeking
  to establish themselves in Australia. How can we use APIs from NAB, Alibaba
  and other third parties to help?
